# FunctionalResult

FunctionalResult is a C# library inspired by the work of Milan Jovanovic. 
It offers a structured approach to functional error handling, using the Result pattern to improve reliability and readability in code. 
This approach is ideal for handling database operations, external service calls, or any scenario where a function might succeed or fail and needs a clear way to communicate outcomes.
